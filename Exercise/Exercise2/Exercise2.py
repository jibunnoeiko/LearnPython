# Exercise 2: Integer and Float Types

# 1. Begin by explicitly determining the type of 6 using the following code:
# type(6)
# You should get the following output: int

# 2. Now, enter type(6.0) in the next cell of your notebook: type(6.0)
# You should get the following output: float

# 3. Now, add 5 to 3.14. Infer the type of their sum: 5 + 3.14
# You should get the following output: 8.14

# 4.   Now, convert 7.999999999 to an int: int(7.999999999)
# You should get the following output: 7

# 5.   Convert 6 to a float: float(6)
# You should get the following output: 6.0
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 1
print(type(6)) # => int

# 2
print(type(6.0)) # => float

# 3
print(5 + 3.14) # => 8.14

# 4
print(int(7.999999999)) # => 7

# 5
print(float(6)) # => 6.0
