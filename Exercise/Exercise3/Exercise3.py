# Exercise 3: Assigning Variables
#
# 1. Set x as equal to the number 2: x = 2
# In the first step, we assigned the value 2 to the x variable.

# 2. Add 1 to the variable x: x + 1
# You should get the following output: 3
# Once we add 1 to x, we get the output of 3, because the variable has 1 added
# to it.

# 3. Change x to 3.0 and add 1 to x: x = 3.0,  x + 1
# You should get the following output: 4.0
# In this step, we change the value of x to 4.0, and as in the previous 2
# steps, we will be adding 1 to the x variable.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 1
x = 2 # => 2
print(x)

# 2
x += 1 # => 3
print(x)

# 3
x = 3.0 # => 3.0
print(x)
x += 1 # => 4.0
print(x)
