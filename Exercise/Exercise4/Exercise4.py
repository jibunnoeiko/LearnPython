# Exercise 4: Variable Names

# 1. Create a variable called 1st_number and assign it a value of 1:
# 1st_number = 1
# You should get the following output: Figure 1.4: Output throwing a syntax error
# You'll get the error mentioned in the preceding screenshot because you cannot
# begin a variable with a number.

# 2. Now, let's try using letters to begin a variable:
# first_number = 1

# 3. Now, use special characters in a variable name, as in the following code:
# my_$ = 1000.00
# You should get the following output: Figure 1.5: Output throwing a syntax error
# You get the error mentioned in Figure 1.4 because you cannot include a variable
# with a special character.

# 4. Now, use letters again instead of special characters for the variable name:
# my_money = 1000.00
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# 1
# 1st_number = 1 # => SyntaxError: invalid syntax

# 2
first_number = 1 # => Okay

# 3
# my_$ = 1000.00 # => SyntaxError: invalid syntax

# 4
my_money = 1000.00 # => Okay
