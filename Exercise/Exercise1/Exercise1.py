# Exercise 1: Getting to Know the Order of Operations

# 1.Subtract 5 to the 3rd power, which is 53
# (100 - 5 ** 3) / 5
# You should get the following output: â€“5.0

# 2.Add 6 to the remainder of 15 divided 4:
# 6 + 15 % 4
# You should get the following output: 9

# 3.Add 2 to the 2nd power, which is 22, to the integer division of 24 and 4:
# 2 ** 2 + 24 // 4
# You should get the following output: 10
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------


# 1
print((100 - 5 ** 3) / 5) # => -5.0

# 2
print(6 + 15 %4) # => 9

# 3
print(2 ** 2 + 24 // 4) # => 10
