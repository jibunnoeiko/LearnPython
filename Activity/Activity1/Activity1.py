# Activity 1: Assigning Values to Variables
# In this activity, you will assign a number to the x variable, increment the number, and
# perform additional operations.
# By completing this activity, you will learn how to perform multiple mathematical
# operations using Python. This activity can be performed in the Jupyter Notebook.
# The steps are as follows:
# 1. First, set 14 to the x variable.
# 2. Now, add 1 to x.
# 3. Finally, divide x by 5 and square it.
#
# Python as a Calculator | 15
#
# You should get the following output:
# 9.0

# Activity 1
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
x = 14
x += 1
print((x/5)**2)
